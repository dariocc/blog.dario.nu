This is a very short post, wouldn't actually call it a post, more a reminder...
I rescued it from node I had written sometime ago and that I didn't really know
where to place and I figured out I'd post it for eternity.

I had this situation in which I wanted to see all the pom.xml files in
a repository containing several submodules arranged hiearchically. Turns out
this is pretty simple `tree` actions.

    tree -P "pom.xml"

Where _P_ stands for _Pattern_.

I realized however that the file was also present in a number of _target_
and _src_ so I needed to exlude this folders, which was also easy to accomplish 
with the `-I` option.

    tree -P 'pom.xml' -I 'target|src'

That was all I had to say.
